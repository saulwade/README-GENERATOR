# Professional README Generator

The aim of the application is to create a markdown file, which will streamline the process of constructing a README file. As a result, more time will be available to focus on developing the production code. The JavaScript code utilizes inquirer dependencies to gather user input, which is then written to a file and used to generate the README using template literals.
